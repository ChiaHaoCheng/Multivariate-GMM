# Univariate-GMM
R package of univariate-type Gaussian Mixture Models

This is my semester final project of STAT533000 Statistical Computing course at Inst. of Statistics, NTHU. 

## R fold.
  This fold stores related R programs that implement GMM. Please click on this file to view how to implement it.
  The enclosed includes:  
    em_GMM.R : Implementing GMM in R.  
    optimal_k.R : Searching for the optimal cluster number k.  
    plot_GMM.R: Visualizing GMM by pairs panel.
    other xxx.R : Load data set xxx by implementing "data( xxx )"  
    
## data fold.
  The data sets required to implement "data( xxx )".

## man fold.
  The required documents is to describe the details of R programs in R fold. For example, when implenmenting "help(xxx)" in R studio, the details for em_GMM will be accessed to the documentation pages for xxx, which xxx indicates R functions, data sets, and other objects.
